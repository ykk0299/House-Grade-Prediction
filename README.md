# House Grade Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting the grade of a house based on various factors. The prediction is carried out using machine learning classification techniques. The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

- id: Identification number of the house
- Area(total): Total area of the house
- Troom: Total number of rooms
- Nbedrooms: Number of bedrooms
- Nbwashrooms: Number of bathrooms
- Twashrooms: Total number of washrooms
- roof: Type of roof
- Roof(Area): Area of the roof
- Lawn(Area): Area of the lawn
- Nfloors: Number of floors
- API: Air Purity Index
- ANB: Number of Amenities in the neighbourhood
- EXPECTED: Expected grade of the house


## Data Cleaning
The dataset underwent a thorough data cleaning process, including handling missing values, and standardizing data formats to ensure the integrity and reliability of the analysis.

## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing was conducted to validate the significance of various features in predicting the house grade. Statistical methods such as t-tests and ANOVA were utilized to assess the relationship between the independent variables and the target variable.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
Multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented in this project, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), gradient boosting machines (GBM), and support vector machines (SVM) to predict the house grade based on the provided features.
